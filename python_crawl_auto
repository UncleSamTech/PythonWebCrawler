A python script that sevrves helps us navigate through an webpage and prints out all 
the links in the webpage. We are assuming that all our links should always start with
@values <a href = 
We are also declaring a variable named
@var page_content which is to hold any webpage content and also another variable named
@var start_link which will hold the index of our first occurence of the 
@values <a href = 
We will then use that help locate the first occurence of our quote of our link 
This is an update on the first version of our web crawler
While the first goes through the page content and prints out the first url, this one creates a procedure that 
goes through all the page and get's the remaining link.
This procedure is set up with an arguement
@args page_content which will be used to get remaining url
The procedure is named get_all_url which returns two values namely 
@val link_url and 
@val end_quote
Please note that the version of this pyhton code as at when it was written is python3.4
Let's dive In ! !

*/
//This variable page content holds all the content of our web page we wish to crawl through
page_content = 'any web page content'

def get_all_url(page_content):
  start_link = page_content.find('<a href')
  start_quote = page_content.find('"', start_link)
  end_quote = page_content.find('"', start_link + 1)
  link_url = page_content[start_quote + 1: end_quote]
  return(link_url, end_quote)
