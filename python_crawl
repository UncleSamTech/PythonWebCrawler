/*
A python script that sevrves helps us navigate through an webpage and prints out all 
the links in the webpage. We are assuming that all our links should always start with
@values <a href = 
We are also declaring a variable named
@var page_content which is to hold any webpage content and also another variable named
@var start_link which will hold the index of our first occurence of the 
@values <a href = 
We will then use that help locate the first occurence of our quote of our link 

Please note that the version of this pyhton code as at when it was written is python3.4
*/
//This variable page content holds all the content of our web page we wish to crawl through
page_content = 'any web page content'
//The variable start_link locates the first position of occurence of "<a href = "
start_link = page_content.find('<a href')
/**The variable locates the position of the first occurence of 
double quote starting from where the '<a href = '  first occured thereby passing
a second parameter of 
@params start_link
*/
start_quote = page_content.find('"', start_link)
/**The variable end_quote holds the end quote for the url we've found
by using the find method and passing two parameters
@params "" which is the quote we are looking for the second parameter
@params start_link + 1 which is starting from position of the occurrence of the first quote
and adding one to it so as to get the next occurence
*/
end_quote = page_content.find('"', start_link + 1)
This variable link will extract only link without the quotes attached
link_url = page_content[start_quote + 1: end_quote]
//This will print our first url for us
print(link_url)
